## Prerequisites

To get started with this project, you need the following:

- A computer with Google Chrome installed.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the custom background for your Chrome browser:

1. **Download the project:** Begin by downloading the project files from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/aimalexe/chrome-background-page).

2. **Open Chrome Extensions page:** Type `chrome://extensions` in the address bar of your Chrome browser and press Enter. This will take you to the Chrome Extensions page.

3. **Enable Developer Mode:** On the Chrome Extensions page, locate the "Developer mode" toggle switch in the top right corner and turn it on.

4. **Load the project:** Click on the "Load unpacked" button that appears after enabling Developer mode. A file picker window will open.

5. **Select project folder:** In the file picker window, navigate to the folder where you downloaded the project files, and select the folder. Click "Select" to load the project.

6. **Verify extension:** Once you have loaded the project folder, you should see the extension listed on the Chrome Extensions page. Ensure that the toggle switch next to the extension is turned on.

7. **Customize the background:** Open a new tab in Chrome, and you should see your custom background displayed. To customize the background, open the `index.html` file in the project folder using a text editor. Modify the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code as per your preferences to create your desired background.

8. **Refresh the extension:** After making any changes to the project files, go back to the Chrome Extensions page and click the refresh button next to the extension. This will apply the updated background to your browser.
